<li> <u>1.49k 9 November 2014</u>
<ul>
<li> Thanks to Hermann-Josef Roeser, the <i>Histogram</i> command does a better
job of plotting histograms with more than 256 bins. To get a dialog that allows
you to specify the number of bins, run the Histogram command by pressing alt-h.
<li> Thanks to Michael Schmid, the <i>Process&gt;FFT&gt;FD Math</i> command
limits the image choices to power of 2 sizes and spatially calibrates
the output image, which now has a unique name. 
<li> The table created by clicking on "List" in histogram windows is now a results table.
<li> Thanks to Michael Schmid, the contrast adjuster no longer disables undo.
<li> On Java 8, ImageJ uses the Rhino JavaScript engine instead
of the built in, but incompatible, Nashorn engine.
<li> Thanks to Christophe Leterrier and Johannes Schindelin, the JavaScript 
interpreter now supports the load() function.
<li> Thanks to Philippe Carl, an ROI selected in the ROI Manager 
is deselected when it is removed from the image.
<li> Thanks to Thomas Templier, the ImageCanvas.setSourceRect() method
now sets the magnification and is more robust
<a href="macros/js/SetSourceRectDemo.js">JavaScript example</a>).
<li> Thanks to Johannes Schindelin, added the ij.macro.Debugger interface.
<li> Thanks to Glen MacDonald, run("Make Binary") macro function not supports
a 'slice' option that allows stacks to be converted to binary using custom
thresholding methods
(<a href="macros/examples/CustomStackThreshold.txt">example</a>).
<li> Thanks to Glen MacDonald, fixed several bugs in the <i>Make Binary</i>
and <i>Convert to Mask</i> commands.
<li> Thanks to Gerhard Hahm, fixed a bug that caused the imageCalculator()
macro function to not select the first (output) image in batch mode macros.
<li> Thanks to Johan, fixed a bug that caused the calibration to not be updated
after updating an existing plot window using the Plot.update() macro function.
<li> Thanks to Michael Schmid, fixed a bug that caused
<i>Edit&gt;Selection&gt;Create Mask</i> to not maintain the spatial 
calibration when converting selections into masks. 
<li> Thanks to Hermann-Josef Roeser, fixed a bug that caused ImageJ to not
correctly open 16-bit, 4 samples per pixel TIFFs, such as those created by VueScan.
