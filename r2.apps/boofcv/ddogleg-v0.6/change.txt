Change log for DDogleg Numerics

Date Format: YEAR-MONTH-DAY

------------------------------------------------------
Version:  0.6
Date:

- Switched build to Gradle
- Added CircularQueue
- QuickSort and QuickSortArray have been combined into one class
- QuickSort comparable index has been added
- Fixed a bug in AxisSplitRuleRandomK where is the number of consider was greater than the DOF it would throw
  an out of bounds exception.
- Added vantage point tree (VpTree).
  * Thanks Karel Petr√°nek
- Fixed bug in KdTreeMemory.recycleGraph().  Didn't check to see if root was null

------------------------------------------------------
Version:  0.5
Date:     2014-06-18

- Added missing functions to GrowQueue_*
- Nearest-neighbor search
  * Maximum distance is specified as inclusive
  * Maximum distance is specified as Euclidean squared
- Added Counting Sort.  Sorts integer valued elements in O(N) time
- Added approximate sort.  Counting sort for continuous valued data
- Fixed bug in SturmSequence where it would get stuck in an infinite loop while bounding the roots
- Tweaked FastQueue so that it is a valid Java Bean

------------------------------------------------------
Version:  0.4
Date:     2013-12-26

- Added N nearest-neighbor search.
  * Modified NearestNeighbor interface
  * Standard K-D tree
  * Best-Bin-First K-D tree
  * Random Forest K-D tree
- Changed behavior of K-D tree constructor
  * Empty leafs will be null instead of identical to the parent.  Duplicate data caused problems when searching
    for the N nearest-neighbors
- Refactored and tweaked documentation for ModelMatcher
- Added ModelMatcherMulti
  * Can be given different types of models to fit the data to
  * RansacMulti added and only implementation of it so far
- Added graph related data structure
- Created ModelManager for making new instances and copying a model
  * removed similar functions from ModelGenerator and ModelFitter
- Added UtilOptimize.step() and changed behavior of UtilOptimize.process()
- Added forwards + backwards numerical differentiation
- Added remove(index)
  * FastQueue and GrowQueue*
- Renamed some optimization functions for getting size of input and output.  Less confusing now.

------------------------------------------------------
Version:  0.3
Date:     2013-04-10

- Added QuickSort_S32

------------------------------------------------------
Version:  0.2
Date:     2013-02-16

- Added Nearest-Neighbor Search
 * Exhaustive
 * K-D Trees
 * K-D Random Forests
- FindRealRootsSturm
 * Fixed bug where it incorrectly handled the case when the max iterations has been exceeded and no roots were found
 * Better handling of contradictory number of real roots

------------------------------------------------------
Version:  0.1
Date:     2012-11-26

- Initial public release
- Code from other projects and cleaned up
