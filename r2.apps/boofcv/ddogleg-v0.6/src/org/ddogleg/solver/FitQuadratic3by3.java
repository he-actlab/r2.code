/**
 * <p>
 * Fit observations to a 2D quadratic around a 3x3 region.  Observations are specified in a local
 * coordinate system with indexes from -1 to 1.  Typically the maximum value is at the local center,
 * (0,0) coordinate.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Even if the center pixel is the max value, it is still possible for peak to be found outside the
 * 3x3 region.  In that situation what happened is that it fit the points inside 3x3 region to one side
 * of the curve.  In many applications the estimate should then be ignored.
 * If the minimum number of points was being considered then it would be impossible to go outside since
 * it must pass through each sample point.
