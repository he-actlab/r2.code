/**
 * <p>
 * Computes the disparity SAD score efficiently for a single rectangular region while minimizing CPU cache misses.
 * After the score has been computed for an entire row it is passed onto another algorithm to compute the actual
 * disparity. Provides support for fast right to left validation.  First the sad score is computed horizontally
 * then summed up vertically while minimizing redundant calculations that naive implementation would have.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Memory usage is minimized by only saving disparity scores for the row being considered.  The more
 * straight forward implementation is to compute the disparity score for the whole image at once,
 * which can be quite expensive.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Score Format:  The index of the score for column i >= radiusX + minDisparity at disparity d is: <br>
 * index = imgWidth*(d-minDisparity-radiusX) + i - minDisparity-radiusX<br>
 * Format Comment:<br>
 * This ordering is a bit unnatural when searching for the best disparity, but reduces cache misses
 * when writing.  Performance boost is about 20%-30% depending on max disparity and image size.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This implementation is not based off of any individual paper but ideas commonly expressed in several different
 * sources.  A good study and summary of similar algorithms can be found in:<br>
 * [1] Wannes van der Mark and Dariu M. Gavrila, "Real-Time Dense Stereo for Intelligent Vehicles"
