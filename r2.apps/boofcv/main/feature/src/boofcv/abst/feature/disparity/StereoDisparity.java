/**
 * <p>
 * Given two rectified images compute the corresponding dense disparity image.  Input images are assumed
 * to be rectified along the x-axis.  Disparity goes from left to right image, thus the x coordinates of pixels
 * in the left and right images have the following relationship x_right = x_left + disparity, and y_right = y_left..
 * To speed up calculations only a limited range of disparities are considered from minDisparity to maxDisparity.
 * Image borders are not processed and the border size is specified by functions below.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * DISPARITY IMAGE FORMAT: Returned disparity image is offset from the true value by minDisparity.  This
 * is done to maximize storage efficiency.  To get the actual disparity value simply extract the value
 * of a pixel and add minDisparity to it.  Invalid pixels are indicated by having a value greater than
 * (maxDisparity - minDisparity).
