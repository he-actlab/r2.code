- FAST improvements
 * Tried using look up table instead of searching with two for loops.
  - Used Float.floatToRawIntBits() to see if floating point numbers were positive or negative
  - Found to be about 5% faster when a larger than normal number of features are detected
  - Decided it was not significantly enough of an improvement to warrant a change
