- Config class for detector/descriptors
  * Configuring those algorithms is a complex task
  * Add Factory.configAlg() to create defaults
  * Simplify factories a bit
  * Simplify combined tracker too

- Faster association
  - FLANN?

- See KLT list

- Non-maximum suppression extraction
 * Non-Maximum Suppression for edges
   - Add a crude version 4 which just checks to see if gradient is > or < 0 to pick direction of line
 * Add sub-pixel using a polynomial fit

- Canny Edge Detector
 * Uses generalized algorithm for non-max right now.  It should use a specialized one for speed that traces
   the edge intensity and direction

- Add whole image detection capability to SSD detectors
 * Hunt through code where it expands the avoid border
 * Main reason for adding image borders is to avoid this headache.

- Ignore Borders
  * WrapperKitRosCornerIntensity: add ignore border parameter for when the derivative has an ignore border?
  * WrapperLaplacianBlobIntensity: same

- Hough Detectors
  * Used round to reduce round off error?  Right now it is equivalent of floor


- Add an escape value to score associate.  if the value computed so far isn't better than X, stop.
