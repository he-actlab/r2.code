- Fundamental Sampson Distance
  * Create this class, residual requires an unnecessary sqrt() for distance calculations

- Compare EPnP directly to author's c code

- Bundle Adjustment
  * Using homogenous coordinates
  * compare to opencv

- Triangulation Stability
  * Vary acute angle

- Trifocal Tensor
  * Refine with Sampson error
  * 6pt algorithm
  * Runtime benchmark

- P3P
  * Implement that complex algorithm

- PoseFromPairLinear6
  * Create abstract interface for this one

- RectifyImageOps
  * delete fullViewLeft() due to potential pathological cases?

- Alternative rotation matrix encoding
  * Look at alternatives to rodrigues 3 because of the singularity
  * Rodrigues 4
  * Euler
  * Quaternions

- Combine common elements of PnPJacobianRodrigues and CalibPoseAndPointRodriguesJacobian?

- Long Term
 * Sparse Bundle Adjustment
 * SVD/Linear PnP  See Long Quan paper
 * Switch homography from DenseMatrix64F to Homography2D_F64?
  - Need to add functions to geometry math or create a new class
  - Also add a generic Matrix3x3_F64 to georegression

- Move Trackers to Features?
- Reconsider how DLT is handled
 * Have normalization be handled outside of the estimator algorithms
 * Change documentation to make this fact extremely clear
