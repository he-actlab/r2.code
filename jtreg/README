The Regression Test Harness for the OpenJDK platform: jtreg


Introduction

jtreg is designed to run test programs written according to the JDK Test 
Framework: Tag Language Specification, on a wide-variety of Javaâ„¢ platforms, 
and specifically those platforms supported by JDK.

This README contains basic information about this version of jtreg. 
Please see the doc/ directory or the online help for more information.

NOTE: To display the jtreg online help without launching the jtreg GUI, use the 
-onlineHelp option. For example, if your current directory is the directory
where you have installed jtreg, you can use the following command to display 
online help:

    > java -jar lib/jtreg.jar -onlineHelp

In the example command, > represents the command prompt. For Unix systems the 
command prompt may be either a shell prompt, such as %, or a user defined value. 
For win32 systems, the command prompt may be C: or another appropriate drive 
identifier.


Release Notes.

This is jtreg, version 4.0. jtreg is to designed as a set of extensions to
Sun's JavaTest harness, which is also available under an open source license
under the name JT Harness.  jtreg 4.0 is suitable for use with JavaTest or 
JT Harness, version 4.1.3 or later. (Note: Older versions of JT Harness have
a different license. Please make sure you are familiar with the terms of the
license for the version you are using.).

The primary change for this release of jtreg is that it now uses 
JavaTest or JTHarness version 4.1.3 or later.  

As a side-effect of using this new version of JavaTest or JT Harness, the layout
of the files in the report directory has changed. An extra level of subdirectory
under the main report directory has been added, to group the files of the 
different types of reports and to improve the way that reports are backed up.


System Requirements

The following sections provide the recommended system requirements for running 
jtreg.

- Java platform
    A platform equivalent to JDK 1.5.0 or later is required.

- Memory
    It is recommended that you run jtreg on a computer having at least 256M of 
    physical memory.
 

Running tests

You can either execute the jtreg.jar file directly, or you can use of the
the wrapper scripts provided in one of the platform-specific bin directories.

To run the JDK regression tests, it is common to set your current directory
to the root of your repository, such as langtools/ or jdk/ and execute a command
of the form:
    
    > jtreg -jdk:<build-image> <tests>
 
where <build-image> represents the path for where you have built JDK, and <tests>
specifies one or more tests or folders of tests in the repository's test/ directory.

If you have just built part of a JDK, you can use the -Xbootclasspath/p: option
for JDK to prepend your classes to the bootclasspath, ahead of a complete version
of JDK:

    > jtreg -jdk:<jdk> -Xbootclasspath/p:<jar-or-classdir> <tests> 

where <jdk> points to a complete JDK, and <jar-or-classdir> points to where
you have prepared your classes to be tested.

Your repository may also provide a NetBeans project that provides Ant targets
to run some or all of the tests in your repository. See the documentation for
your repository for more details.
